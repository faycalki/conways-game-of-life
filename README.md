# Conway's Game of Life - Matrix-Vector Sparse Implementation

## Overview

This project implements Conway's Game of Life using matrix-vector operations and sparse matrices. The simulation custom operations along with sparse matrix representations (CSR format) to update the state of the grid over a series of generations.

## Features

- **Matrix Operations:** Reads an initial grid from a text file (`init.txt`), vectorizes it, and constructs a sparse neighbor matrix in CSR format.
- **Simulation:** Runs 25 generations of Conway's Game of Life, updating the state based on neighbor counts.
- **Visualization:** Uses matplotlib to display each generation with a brief pause between updates.
- **Output:** Saves the final state to `final_state.txt`.


## Conway's Game of Life: Code to Mathematical Concept Mapping

|Mathematical Concept|Code Implementation|Variable Mapping|Constraints & Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|Grid representation (X)|`read_matrix()` in matrix_operations.py|X = 2D matrix from init.txt|Each cell contains 0 (dead) or 1 (alive)|
|Vectorized grid (x)|`vectorize()` and `matrixify()` in matrix_operations.py|x = flattened version of X in row-major order|Length must be MATRIX_ROWS Ã— MATRIX_COLS|
|Neighbor counting matrix (A)|`build_neighbor_matrix()` in matrix_operations.py|Returns (rows, cols, data) in COO format|Each cell has up to 8 neighbors|
|Sparse matrix storage|`compressed_sparse_row_format()` in matrix_operations.py|(values, col_index, row_ptr) = CSR representation|Efficient for sparse matrices|
|Matrix-vector multiplication (y = Ax)|`matrix_multiply_csr()` in matrix_operations.py|neighbor_counts = multiplication result|Calculates live neighbors for each cell|
|State transition rules|`time_step()` in conway_backend.py|Implements all 4 GoL rules|Cell state depends on neighbor count and current state|
|Iteration counter (k)|`generation` in main()|Tracks current generation number|Runs for a predefined number of generations|
|Initializing simulation|`initialize_conways()` in conway_backend.py|Sets up X, x, and A matrix|Starting point for the simulation|
|Converting between representations|`matrixify()` in matrix_operations.py|Converts vector back to matrix for display|Used after each time step|
|Algorithm step 1|`build_neighbor_matrix()` in matrix_operations.py|Creates matrix A for counting neighbors|Follows PDF's COO matrix construction approach|

|Algorithm step 4|`matrix_multiply_csr()` in matrix_operations.py|y^(k) = Ax^(k)|Calculates neighbor counts vector|
|Algorithm step 5|`time_step()` in conway_backend.py|x^(k) becomes x^(k+1)|Applies the four GoL rules|
|Algorithm step 6|`matrixify()` and `display()`|Reshapes x^(k+1) to X^(k+1) and plots|Visual representation of current state|

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages:
  - `matplotlib`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib 
```
File Structure

    main.py:
    Contains the main entry point. The main() function invokes the simulation, initializes the grid from init.txt, updates the grid for each generation, and displays the results.

    conway_backend.py:
    Handles the simulation logic by reading the initial state, building the sparse neighbor matrix, and updating the grid state for each generation.

    conway_frontend.py:
    Contains functions for visualizing the grid (displaying the current generation) and saving the final state to a text file.

    matrix_operations.py:
    Implements all matrix and vector operations, including functions for reading a matrix from file, vectorization, matrix multiplication (both standard and sparse/CSR-based), and building the neighbor matrix.

    init.txt:
    Contains the initial grid configuration. This file should be present in the same folder as the Python scripts. An example for a 5x5 grid might look like:

    0 1 1 0 0
    0 1 1 0 0
    0 0 0 0 1
    1 0 0 1 1
    1 1 0 0 0

How to Use

    Ensure all required files are in one folder:
    Make sure main.py, conway_backend.py, conway_frontend.py, matrix_operations.py, and init.txt are located in the same directory.

    Prepare your init.txt file:
    Edit or create an init.txt file with the desired initial grid. Each row should contain space-separated values (0 for dead, 1 for alive).

    Run the Program:
    Execute the main program by running main.py. This will automatically invoke the main() function:

    python main.py

    The simulation will run for 25 generations, displaying each generation in a matplotlib window. After the simulation, the final grid state is saved in final_state.txt.
